# AWS ElastiCache Redis Cluster Resiliency & Recovery Document

## 1. Introduction

This document describes the architecture, required configuration settings, and detailed recovery procedures for an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis deployment using Global Datastore with cluster mode enabled and Multi-AZ enabled. It is intended to serve as a guide for provisioning a resilient Redis cluster and for recovering from various failure scenarios to minimize downtime and data loss.

## 2. Architectural Overview

### 2.1. Key Features
- **Cluster Mode Enabled:**  
  - **Partitioning (Sharding):** Data is partitioned across multiple shards for scalability and improved performance.
  - **High Throughput & Low Latency:** The distribution of load across shards enables efficient processing of requests.

- **Multi-AZ Enabled:**  
  - **High Availability:** Synchronous replication across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) ensures failover protection if an AZ becomes unavailable.
  - **Automatic Failover:** When a primary node in an AZ fails, the system automatically promotes a read replica in a different AZ to primary.

- **Global Datastore for Redis:**  
  - **Cross-Region Disaster Recovery:** Provides asynchronous replication to a secondary AWS region, offering resilience against regional failures.
  - **Operational Readiness:** Enables fast recovery by promoting the secondary datastore to primary in the event of a region-wide outage.

### 2.2. Components
- **Primary Region Cluster:**  
  - The main deployment with cluster mode enabled and Multi-AZ configuration.
- **Secondary Region Cluster (Global Datastore Replica):**  
  - A read-only replica that asynchronously replicates data from the primary region.
- **Network & Security:**  
  - VPC configurations, Security Groups, Subnets, and appropriate IAM roles.
- **Monitoring & Maintenance:**  
  - CloudWatch for performance monitoring and alarms.
  - Scheduled maintenance windows and backups.

## 3. Required Configuration for Provisioning

### 3.1. Redis Cluster Configuration
- **Cluster Mode:**  
  - Enable cluster mode during provisioning.
  - Define the number of shards and replicas per shard according to your scalability and availability requirements.

- **Multi-AZ Configuration:**  
  - Enable automatic Multi-AZ failover.
  - Ensure at least one replica exists in a different AZ per shard.
  - Configure the failover settings (e.g., failover priority) as needed.

- **Global Datastore Setup:**
  - **Primary Cluster:**  
    - Create a Redis replication group in your primary region with the desired settings.
  - **Secondary Cluster:**  
    - Using the Global Datastore feature, add a secondary cluster in the target region.
    - Ensure that the secondary region meets network and security requirements.
  - **Replication Configuration:**  
    - Verify that asynchronous replication is configured correctly between primary and secondary clusters.
    - Monitor replication lag and health.

### 3.2. Backup & Snapshot Settings
- **Automated Backups:**
  - Enable automated backups.
  - Define the backup retention period and schedule snapshots during low-traffic periods.
- **Manual Snapshots:**
  - Periodically take manual snapshots, especially before major updates.

### 3.3. Security and Network Settings
- **VPC & Subnets:**
  - Place the clusters in a VPC with private subnets to restrict direct internet access.
- **Security Groups:**
  - Configure inbound/outbound rules to allow only authorized access.
- **Encryption:**
  - Enable encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest.
- **IAM Policies:**
  - Define strict IAM policies and roles for managing ElastiCache clusters.

### 3.4. Monitoring and Logging
- **CloudWatch Metrics:**
  - Monitor CPU, memory usage, replication lag, network throughput, and error rates.
- **Alarms:**
  - Configure alarms for key metrics to trigger notifications in case of anomalies.
- **Logging:**
  - Enable logging for both application-level and system-level events.

## 4. Recovery Procedures

The following recovery procedures outline the steps to restore operations in case of a failure in either the primary region, a shard/node within the cluster, or other disaster scenarios.

### 4.1. Scenario 1: Failure of a Node or Shard within the Primary Cluster
- **Automatic Failover (Multi-AZ):**
  1. **Detection:**  
     - CloudWatch alarms and internal ElastiCache monitoring detect the failure.
  2. **Failover:**  
     - The Multi-AZ configuration automatically promotes a replica in a different AZ to primary.
  3. **Validation:**  
     - Confirm that the promoted node is now handling writes and that the cluster is operational.
  4. **Post-Failover Steps:**  
     - Verify client connectivity.
     - Monitor for any residual issues and check logs for errors.

- **Manual Recovery (if automatic failover does not trigger):**
  1. **Identify the Issue:**  
     - Use the AWS Console and CloudWatch logs to determine the root cause.
  2. **Initiate Manual Failover:**  
     - From the AWS Console, select the failed node or shard and trigger a manual failover.
  3. **Update Endpoints:**  
     - Ensure your application points to the new primary endpoint if needed.
  4. **Test Functionality:**  
     - Confirm that read and write operations are functioning correctly.

### 4.2. Scenario 2: Regional Failure of the Primary Region
- **Promote Global Datastore Secondary Cluster:**
  1. **Assess the Situation:**  
     - Verify that the primary region is unavailable or degraded.
     - Confirm that the secondary Global Datastore cluster is healthy.
  2. **Promotion Process:**
     - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
     - Navigate to the Global Datastore configuration.
     - Select the secondary replication group and choose the option to promote it to primary.
  3. **Endpoint Update:**
     - Update your application configuration (or DNS records) to point to the new primary endpoint.
  4. **Reconfigure Clients and Applications:**
     - Ensure that all clients and dependent services reconnect using the new endpoint.
  5. **Post-Promotion Monitoring:**
     - Monitor replication lag (if the old primary recovers and is later added as a replica) and overall cluster health.

### 4.3. Scenario 3: Data Corruption or Unrecoverable State
- **Restore from Snapshots:**
  1. **Identify the Corruption:**  
     - Use logs and monitoring tools to confirm data corruption.
  2. **Select a Valid Snapshot:**  
     - Choose the most recent snapshot before the corruption occurred.
  3. **Provision a New Cluster:**
     - Create a new replication group from the selected snapshot.
     - Configure the new cluster with the same settings (cluster mode, Multi-AZ, Global Datastore) as the original.
  4. **Switch Over:**
     - Update the application endpoints to point to the new cluster.
  5. **Verify Data Integrity:**
     - Confirm that the restored data is valid and that operations are normal.
  6. **Investigate and Document:**  
     - Determine the cause of the data corruption to prevent recurrence.

## 5. Best Practices and Maintenance

- **Regular Testing:**
  - Conduct regular failover drills to validate the recovery process.
  - Test backup restoration periodically to ensure data can be recovered.
- **Automation:**
  - Use AWS CloudFormation, Terraform, or other IaC (Infrastructure as Code) tools to automate deployment and recovery processes.
- **Documentation and Runbooks:**
  - Maintain updated runbooks that detail each recovery procedure.
  - Document any changes to the architecture or configurations.
- **Monitoring & Alerts:**
  - Continuously monitor the health of both primary and secondary clusters.
  - Set up real-time alerts for key metrics and events.
- **Security Reviews:**
  - Regularly audit VPC, Security Groups, and IAM policies.
  - Keep encryption standards up-to-date.

  1. Automatic Failover
With Multi-AZ enabled, ElastiCache is designed to handle an AZ failure automatically:

Synchronous Replication:
Each shard typically has a primary node in one AZ and one or more replicas in different AZs. Synchronous replication ensures that data is kept in sync.

Automatic Promotion:
If the primary node becomes unreachable due to an AZ failure, ElastiCache will automatically promote a replica from another healthy AZ to become the new primary. This failover process minimizes downtime.

DNS Endpoint Management:
The cluster’s endpoint remains the same; AWS manages the redirection to the newly promoted primary, so client applications usually do not need to change connection strings.
