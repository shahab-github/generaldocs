### Using the Headlamp Kubernetes Dashboard
1. Overview
The Headlamp dashboard is a user-friendly interface for managing Kubernetes clusters. It allows you to visualize and interact with cluster resources, such as pods, services, and nodes, without needing to use the command line.

2. Accessing the Headlamp Dashboard
Step 1: Open the Dashboard URL
Access the Headlamp dashboard by navigating to the URL provided by your administrator. This will look something like https://<your-headlamp-url>/.

### Step 2: Log in
You will be prompted to log in using your organization’s authentication method (e.g., Single Sign-On).
Enter your credentials to access the dashboard.

### Step 3: Set Allowed Namespaces
After logging in, follow these steps to view the resources you have access to:

Go to the Settings menu (typically in the top right corner).
Under the Allowed Namespaces section, type the name of the namespaces you are allowed to access.
Only the resources within these namespaces will be displayed on the dashboard.

### 3. Navigating the Dashboard
Here’s an overview of the key sections:

Workloads
Pods: View the current state of your pods (running, pending, or failed). You can see detailed information and logs for troubleshooting.
Deployments: Manage your app deployments and view their current status.
Networking
Services: Check services running in the cluster, including their IPs and ports.
Ingresses: See how traffic is routed to your services.
Configuration
ConfigMaps and Secrets: View configuration settings and secrets being used by the applications in your cluster.
Cluster Resources
Nodes: View the cluster’s nodes and their resource usage, such as CPU and memory.
Namespaces: Organize resources within different namespaces for better management.

### 4. Performing Common Actions
Here are some common tasks you can perform using the Headlamp dashboard:

View Pod Logs
Go to Workloads > Pods.
Select the pod whose logs you want to view.
Click on the Logs tab to monitor logs in real time.
Scale a Deployment
Navigate to Workloads > Deployments.
Select the deployment you want to scale.
Use the Actions dropdown to adjust the number of replicas.
Monitor Node Performance
Go to Cluster Resources > Nodes.
Review the CPU and memory usage to monitor the health and performance of your nodes.

### 5. Dashboard Tips
Filter Views: Use filters to view resources by namespace or labels, helping you narrow down what you need to see.
Search: Use the search bar at the top to quickly find resources, such as specific pods or services.
Refresh: The dashboard auto-refreshes, but you can also manually refresh views if needed.

### 6. Conclusion
The Headlamp dashboard makes it easier to interact with and manage your Kubernetes cluster, without requiring command-line expertise. Use it to view resources, troubleshoot issues, and monitor your cluster’s health—all from a user-friendly web interface.

### 7. User Permissions
Access to features and actions within the Headlamp dashboard is based on your assigned permissions. These permissions are managed through roles and role bindings set by the administrators.

Limited Access: Depending on your role, you may only be able to view certain resources or perform specific actions (e.g., viewing logs but not deleting pods).
If you require additional permissions or encounter access issues, please contact the administrator for assistance.
